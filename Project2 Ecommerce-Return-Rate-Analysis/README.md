## 📌 Problem Statement

An e-commerce company has **5,000 orders** across 5 product categories. Every returned order costs the company ₹200 in reverse logistics — and the business doesn't know which orders will be returned or why.

**Goal →** Use data science to find **why** customers are returning products, **where** returns are happening most, and **predict** which future orders are likely to be returned.

## 📋 Business Recommendations

Based on data analysis, six key interventions were identified —

1. **Clothing Quality Control** — Improve size guides and product descriptions to reduce Size Issue and Changed Mind returns
2. **Supplier Audit** — Review suppliers with high defective return rates and set quality benchmarks
3. **Discount Strategy** — Avoid high discounts on already high-return categories like Clothing
4. **City-Level Targeting** — Investigate City44, City85, City77 for logistics or product issues
5. **Payment Method Risk** — Add extra confirmation step for Credit Card and COD orders above threshold price
6. **Predictive Alert System** — Use ML model to flag high-risk orders before dispatch for quality re-check
